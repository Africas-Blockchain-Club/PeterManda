# My Web3 Journey and Blockchain Research Repository

Welcome to my all things blockchain repository! Here, I document my journey in web3 technology and my passion for researching all things blockchain-related. As an enthusiast in this field, I am committed to sharing my insights, experiences, and findings through articles and projects.

## About Me

I am deeply fascinated by blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionise various industries and address global challenges. My interest in blockchain extends beyond theoretical research; I actively engage in practical exploration and project ideation to harness the power of blockchain for positive social impact.

## What You will Find Here

### 1. Articles on Blockchain

I regularly publish articles covering a wide range of topics in blockchain technology. From introductory guides to in-depth analyses of the latest trends and developments, my articles aim to educate and inspire others to explore the transformative potential of blockchain.

### 2. Project Ideation for SDGs

In addition to articles, I am passionate about leveraging blockchain technology to address the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through project ideation and collaboration, I explore innovative solutions that align with the [17 global goals](https://www.un.org/en/exhibits/page/sdgs-17-goals-transform-world#:~:text=GOAL%201%3A%20No%20Poverty%20GOAL,10%3A%20Reduced%20Inequalities%20GOAL%2011) to create a better and more sustainable world by 2030.

### Why Blockchain for SDGs?

I firmly believe that blockchain technology has the capacity to solve many of the pressing issues outlined in the SDGs. By promoting transparency, decentralisation, and trust, blockchain can facilitate more efficient and equitable solutions to complex societal challenges, ultimately contributing to the achievement of all SDGs by 2030.

### Project Structure

The plan is to have at least one project per SDG that blockchain can solve. To facilitate collaboration and development, each project has its own subdirectory or repository. Here's how I plan for and set up a subdirectory or repo:

1. **Subdirectory Setup:**
   - I create a separate directory for each SDG project within this repository.
   - I organise each subdirectory with clear naming conventions, e.g., "SDG1_No_Poverty", "SDG2_Zero_Hunger", etc.

2. **README Content for Subdirectories:**
   - In the README.md file of each subdirectory, I provide a brief overview of the project idea and its alignment with the corresponding SDG.
   - I share my research findings and insights into how blockchain technology can be leveraged to address the specific challenges outlined in the SDG.
   - I include information about blockchain tech stacks or platforms that can be used to bring the project idea to life, along with any relevant resources or references.

## Get Involved

If you share my passion for blockchain technology and social impact, I invite you to explore this repository, engage with the content, and join me on this exciting journey towards a brighter future powered by blockchain.
