# Token Analysis Blueprint v1.0
Liquidity-First Forensic Audit for Any Cryptocurrency Token

**Purpose**: Repeatable framework for data-driven investment decisions. Focus on realising profits (liquidity = you can actually take them).

### Step 1: Tokenomics & Supply Dynamics
- Fixed vs. dynamic supply
- Lost/illiquid supply (Glassnode HODL waves, Chainalysis estimates)
- Institutional/government treasuries (Arkham Intelligence, CoinGecko Treasuries)
- For dynamic assets: Burn vs. issuance offset (ultrasound.money style — deflationary = bullish scarcity)

### Step 2: Institutional & Leverage Cycle Detection
- Holdings concentration (% owned by entities)
- ETF/corporate flows
- Collateral use: Borrow against holdings, basis trades, short setups on negative funding
- Cycle: Accumulate → leverage amplify → sell into strength → re-accumulate lower

### Step 3: Derivatives & Leverage
- Open Interest (OI), funding rates, liquidation clusters (Coinglass, Hyblock Capital)
- Cascade risk (downside liqs) vs. squeeze potential (upside)

### Step 4: Liquidity Analysis (Critical for Profit Realization)
- 24h volume / market cap ratio (>5–10% = healthy velocity)
- Order-book depth (±1–2% on major exchanges)
- Bid-ask spread & slippage simulation ($1M–$10M+ orders)
- Key insight: High liquidity = clean exits even on large positions. Thin liquidity = slippage eats gains or traps you.

### Step 5: Holistic Synthesis & Trade Signals
- **Enter**: Scarcity improving + institutional accumulation + balanced leverage + strong liquidity
- **Exit/Trail**: Over-leverage extremes + liquidity thinning + institutional sell signals
- Goal: Consistent small profits that compound safely (because liquidity lets you take them)

### Step 6: Source Layer (Unique Alpha Only)
- Core: CoinGecko, Arkham, Glassnode
- Unique: ultrasound.money (ETH burns), Coinglass/Hyblock (leverage/heatmaps), Dune Analytics (custom queries)
