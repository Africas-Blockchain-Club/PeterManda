# Blueprint: Token Analysis for Profitable, Liquidity-Aware Trading
Liquidity-First Forensic Audit for Any Cryptocurrency Token

**Purpose**: Repeatable framework for data-driven investment decisions. Focus on realising profits (liquidity = you can actually take them).

### Step 1: Tokenomics & Supply Dynamics
- Fixed vs. dynamic supply
- Lost/illiquid supply (Glassnode HODL waves, Chainalysis estimates)
- Institutional/government treasuries (Arkham Intelligence, CoinGecko Treasuries)
- For dynamic assets: Burn vs. issuance offset (ultrasound.money style — deflationary = bullish scarcity)

### Step 2: Institutional & Leverage Cycle Detection
- Holdings concentration (% owned by entities)
- ETF/corporate flows
- Collateral use: Borrow against holdings, basis trades, short setups on negative funding
- Cycle: Accumulate → leverage amplify → sell into strength → re-accumulate lower

### Step 3: Derivatives & Leverage
- Open Interest (OI), funding rates, liquidation clusters (Coinglass, Hyblock Capital)
- Cascade risk (downside liqs) vs. squeeze potential (upside)

### Step 4: Liquidity Analysis (Critical for Realising Profits)
Metrics to track (live via APIs or CoinGecko/Coinglass/Amberdata/Kaiko):
- 24h spot volume / market cap (Liquidity Turnover Ratio; >5–10% = healthy).
- Order-book depth (±1% / ±2% on Binance, Bybit, OKX – aim for $100M+ for majors).
- Bid-ask spread (tight <0.05–0.1% ideal).
- Slippage for realistic sizes (1M to 10M dollars orders; <0.5% = excellent).
- Derivatives liquidity (perps volume vs. spot, OI sustainability).

Why liquidity is make-or-break:
- High liquidity = you can exit huge positions (even 100+ BTC or 10k+ ETH) with minimal slippage → lock in profits cleanly, compound small wins.
- Low liquidity = massive slippage eats gains, or you're trapped (price moves against you while selling).
- Liquidity dries up in bears → cascades worsen. 
- Concentrate on bulls → easier big exits.
- Majors (BTC) have structural depth; alts can evaporate overnight.
- Institutions provide liquidity (market-making) but pull it in stress → watch depth contraction as early warning.
- On-chain/DEX liquidity matters for alts (Uniswap pools); CEX dominates spot for majors.
- Follow it for timing: Enter during rising volume/depth; exit in high-volume windows; avoid thin books (e.g., weekends, low-activity periods).

### Step 5: Holistic Synthesis & Trade Signals
- **Enter**: Scarcity improving + institutional accumulation + balanced leverage + strong liquidity
- **Exit/Trail**: Over-leverage extremes + liquidity thinning + institutional sell signals
- Goal: Consistent small profits that compound safely (because liquidity lets you take them)

### Step 6: Source Layer (Unique Alpha Only)
- Core: CoinGecko, Arkham, Glassnode
- Unique: Ultrasound.money (burns), Coinglass (leverage/liquidity), Dune (custom), Hyblock (heatmaps)
