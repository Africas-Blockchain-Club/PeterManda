# Data Science Report: Ethereum On-Chain Audit (February 11, 2026)

## 1. Verified Asset Inventory (Exact Values – Hard On-Chain Data)

| Entity | Exact Verified Value | Primary Data Source | Reliability | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------|
| Public Companies + Governments (total treasuries) | 6,301,185 ETH | CoinGecko Ethereum Treasuries | High | 5.22% of total supply (~$12.8B @ $2,025) |
| BitMine Immersion (largest) | 4,325,738 ETH | CoinGecko + recent filings | High | Aggressive accumulation (+157k last 30d) |
| SharpLink | 864,840 ETH | CoinGecko | High | — |
| The Ether Machine | 496,712 ETH | CoinGecko | High | — |
| Lost / Irreversible Errors + Dormant | ~900k+ ETH | Etherscan + historical reports | Medium | Permanent reduction |

## 2. Supply Dynamics (ultrasound.money Live Model – The "ETH Equivalent" of Fixed Supply)

**Current total supply:** 121,443,900 ETH  
**7-day net change:** +17,902 ETH (mildly inflationary)  
**Burn rate:** ~1,007 ETH (0.10 ETH/min)  
**Issuance:** ~18,910 ETH  
**Offset:** 0.05× (burn only 5% of issuance)

**Annualised supply growth:** +0.77%

## 3. Supply in Profit / Loss (Glassnode – Direct Parallel to BTC Chart)

**Percent Supply in Profit:** ~49–52% (recent dip below 50% in loss territory)

This is the ETH version of the "convergence zone" we saw in BTC.

## 4. HODL Waves / Long-Term Holder Behaviour

ETH HODL waves showing continued distribution from long-term holders (classic top signal when waves compress downward).

## 5. Liquidity & Institutional Leverage Cycle Note

**Spot volume/MC ratio** ~9% (healthy velocity) but order-book depth thinner than BTC (~$400–450M at 2%).

Institutions accumulating (treasuries up), yet thinner books = higher slippage on exits → trail profits aggressively.

## 6. Derivatives Snapshot (Coinglass)

**OI:** ~$24B  
**Funding:** Slightly negative  
**24h liqs:** ~$59M (ETH share)

**Signal:** Leverage skew still present → caution on size.

## 7. Final Synthesis

Dynamic supply (can flip deflationary on activity spikes) + growing institutional ownership (~5.2%) + healthy volume velocity.

But thinner liquidity + current mild inflation + leverage skew = higher exit risk than BTC.

**Blueprint score: Moderate** – enter only on burn > issuance + depth recovery + positive funding flip. Size smaller and trail tightly.
